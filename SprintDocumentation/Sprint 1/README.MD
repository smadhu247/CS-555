# Sprint 1

## There are four parts to this assignment:

### Part 1. Executing Sprint 1:

Perform the tasks and complete the user stories as identified for this sprint. Record actual sizes and times and copy those where appropriate on the Project Backlog page.
Update the Burndown sheet and calculate your velocities for the sprint.
Make sure that you create a line-oriented application that allows for a demonstration to the customer.
Make sure that you commit the completed version of your source code to your GitHub repository.

### Part 2. Demonstrating the results of Sprint 1:

Execute your system on the acceptance test file.
Capture the output in a separate Test Results file. This is the demonstration for the customer.
### Part 3. Reviewing Sprint 1:

At a team meeting, review the results of the sprint.
Make a list of the things you want to keep doing, and a list of the things that you want to avoid doing in the future.
Record the lists at the bottom of the Sprint1 sheet.
###Part 4. Planning Sprint 2:

At a team meeting, decide which user stories will be completed in the next sprint.
Update the Backlog sheet and the Sprint 2 sheet to show this, including ownership and estimates of all tasks and user stories for Sprint 2.
Submit your Project Sprint Report, your acceptance test file, and your Test Results from Sprint 1 as a single zipped archive file to this Canvas assignment. Make sure that the name of your GitHub repository is included on the Team sheet of your Project Sprint Report. The instructor needs this to review your source code.
